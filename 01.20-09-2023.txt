Basics of Computer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harddisk -The size of the hard disk can in the level of TB. It stores the data permanently. Speed to read and write is slow. 
RAM - Random Access Memory. The size of the RAM is always in the form of 2^n.It is a temperary storage area. Reading and writing the data is very fast.
Cache - It will help the processor to give results faster by storing the history.
CPU -  CPU consists of Hard disk, RAM, Cache.It is the heart of the computer. Very Less amount of Memory.

Basics of Communication
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developer -> Build and Deploy -> Server -> Database

Basics of Communication between client and server:
-------------------------------------------------
Client - Makes a request either through an application or something.
Load Balancer - The purpose of load balancer is to split the request to different servers.
Log - The log consists of all the request and response details.
Metrics - The health check of the server is done by comparing the log and the server data.


Example : Consider whatsapp is sending an request. First the request is sent to the load balancer and then to 
the server and the response is generated from the server.

Scenerio : OTPs in whatsapp
--------------------------
If a person books a ticket in redbus or orders something in meesho the OTP is generated and sent to the person's 
whatsapp number. In this kind of things the redbus or the meesho server communicates with the whatsapp server.

Process involved in developing and deploying an application:
------------------------------------------------------------
Coding --> Build and deploy --> Server --> Database

How servers are commnicated?
Servers are communicated using the IP address.

TCP vs UDP
----------
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
1. Slow 
2. Incase of any data loss data can be retrived
3. Three way hand shaking

UDP - User Datagram Protocol
1. Fast 
2. Incase of any data loss data cannot be retrived
3. Example : Video Call

How Data is transferred in packets?
A packet Consists of the header information like the size of the packet and the order.

API 
------------------------------
API - Application Programming Interface
An Api is used to communicate between two software components

Types of API
1. REST - Representational State Transfer
2. GraphQL
3. gRPC

HTTP Methods:
------------
1. GET 
2. POST 
3. PUT 
4. DELETE

DNS
--------------------------------------------
Domain Name System 
The DNS is used to get the IP using the name.

Example: Google.com --> Google IP

Git vs github
------------------------------------------------
Git is used for the local user purpose to develop and make changes in the code.
github is used to commit and push the project that the person developed and to make the changes live in the github.
 
CDN 
----------------------------------------------
Content Delivery Network is used to communicated with the main server via multiple servers.
